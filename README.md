# CodeAThon Problem Statement: Music Mood Classifier and Lyrics Generator

**Background:**
Music is a universal language that conveys emotions and stories to its listeners. Understanding the sentiment behind a song's lyrics can provide insights into its mood and impact on the audience. With the vast library of songs available on platforms like Spotify, there's a significant opportunity to analyze and categorize music based on the emotions they express.

**Dataset:**
The "Spotify Music" dataset provided includes the following columns:
- **Artist**: The name of the artist who performed the song.
- **Song**: The title of the song.
- **Link**: A link to listen to the song.
- **Lyrics**: The complete lyrics of the song.

**Objective:**
The goal of this hackathon is twofold:
1. **Music Mood Classifier**: Develop an algorithm that analyzes the lyrics of songs to classify their mood into categories such as Happy, Sad, Angry, Relaxing, etc. This involves performing sentiment analysis on the lyrics to understand the emotions conveyed by the song. Your model should be able to accurately predict the mood of a song based on its lyrics.
   
2. **Lyrics Generator Based on Mood**: Utilizing the insights gained from the sentiment analysis, create a model that can generate song lyrics based on a specified mood. This model should take a mood category as input and output a set of lyrics that reflect the sentiment of that mood.

**Expected Deliverables:**
- A detailed report or presentation outlining your methodology for sentiment analysis and mood classification. This should include data preprocessing steps, the model(s) used, and the rationale behind your choices.
- A functional prototype of the music mood classifier. This should be able to take the lyrics of a song as input and classify its mood.
- A creative lyrics generator that can produce lyrics based on a specified mood. The generator should demonstrate creativity and relevance to the input mood.
- A brief evaluation of the performance of both models, including accuracy of mood classification and the quality/relevance of the generated lyrics.

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- **Innovation and Creativity**: Originality of the approach and creativity in the solution and generated lyrics.
- **Accuracy and Performance**: The accuracy of the mood classifier and the relevance of the lyrics generated by the model.
- **Technical Implementation**: The efficiency and scalability of the solution, including code quality and the use of data science and machine learning best practices.
- **Presentation**: Clarity and thoroughness in the presentation of the project, including the explanation of the methodology, results, and potential impact.
  

This CodeAThon presents a unique opportunity to explore the intersection of music, emotions, and technology. 
Good luck, and let the music inspire your innovation!
